      <p>Lord Krishna is a revered deity in Hinduism, known as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and an 
        important figure in the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita. His name means "all-attractive" 
        and he is depicted as having blue-black skin. Krishna's life story features divine feats like lifting 
        Govardhan Hill, his role as a guide and friend, and his teachings on dharma and devotion.</p>

      <p>Hanuman is a major deity in Hinduism, featured prominently in the Ramayana, known for 
        his immense strength, unwavering devotion to Lord Rama, and loyalty. He is often 
        depicted as a monkey-like being and is considered the son of the wind god, Vayu, 
        and the celestial maiden Anjana. Hanuman possesses supernatural powers, including
         the ability to fly and assume any form, and is worshipped as a symbol of courage 
         and selfless service.</p>

      <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, 
        is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated
         species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have 
         shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.
          It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat, but it also ranges freely as a 
          feral cat, avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship 
          and its ability to kill vermin.</p>

      <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, 
        characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, 
        a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size 
        from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 
        living species and they are split into 44 orders. More than half are passerine or "perching" birds.
